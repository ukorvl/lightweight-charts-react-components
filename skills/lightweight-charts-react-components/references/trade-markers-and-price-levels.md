# Trade markers and price levels

Use this for execution history, strategy signals, entry/stop/target overlays, or
click-to-place horizontal levels. These are visual annotations. The chart does
not execute orders, persist edits, or turn a marker into a drawing tool.

## Choose the annotation by what it represents

Keep domain IDs stable. A level's React key must be its ID, not its changing price,
so edits update an existing price line. Marker order must be ascending by time;
multiple markers can belong to one candle. `Markers` expects the **complete list**
on every reactive change, including `[]` to clear it.

## Recipe: executions, editable levels, and click-to-place alerts

`candles` is an ascending unique UTC-second snapshot. Each execution's `barTime`
already identifies its containing candle on that exact timeline. The market-data
adapter must map an execution instant to a bar using the venue's interval and
session rules. A naive local-time rounding operation is unsafe for session-based
bars. Events outside loaded history are retained upstream and become visible
when that history is loaded.

Validate `tickSize` as a positive finite number and `precision` as the instrument's
supported nonnegative integer before rendering. The rounding above is display
rounding for a tick grid starting at zero. Instruments with different price-band
rules need the venue-specific quantizer; do not reuse this as an order validator.
`initialLevels` is a mount-time seed. Mount by instrument ID or replace it with a
controlled `levels`/`onLevelsChange` contract when annotation state lives upstream.

## Lifecycle and adaptation details

`PriceLine` reacts to both `price` and `options` changes and removes its upstream
line when unmounted. The explicit `price` prop is separate from `options`; do
not put the price only inside options. Disabling the candle series' default last
price line reduces visual confusion with domain levels.

`Markers` creates the upstream plugin and updates marker lists reactively, but
the current hook does not apply new `options` after creation. To change a plugin
option such as `zOrder`, remount `Markers` with a key identifying that option or
call `markersRef.current?.api()?.applyOptions(...)`. The latter requires a
`MarkersApiRef` and initialized API. Showing/hiding the list uses `markers={[]}`
without recreating the plugin.

For marker click details, `MouseEventParams.hoveredObjectId` can identify a marker
whose `id` was supplied. Resolve it against application execution IDs. For
draggable lines or regions, implement interaction and hit testing in a drawing
plugin; `PriceLine` alone has no drag callbacks.

Keep persistence and network changes in the application's annotation store.
Changing local chart state should not imply placing a live order or registering
an alert on a server. Add the application's explicit save/submit flow if requested.

## Acceptance checks

- Add two executions to the same candle, reorder input, and verify sorted markers
  remain. Hide them and verify the complete list is cleared; show them again.
- Edit a level's price and title without changing its ID. Remove it and verify the
  line disappears. Change instrument and verify annotations do not leak across it.
- In placement mode, click the price pane at a known price. Verify tick rounding.
  Add another pane and verify clicks there do not create levels on the price series.
- Change marker options and verify the chosen remount/API path actually applies
  them; simply changing the options prop is insufficient in the current hook.
